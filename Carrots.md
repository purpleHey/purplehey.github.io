A list of carrots that I can come back to when I get something useful done first!

## Questions
* Do I have to use sudo to do the docker?
* How do I do the [python migrations from within docker](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33992867/how-do-you-perform-django-database-migrations-when-using-docker-compose#)?
* How come when I did >docker-compose up, it didn't build the first time I set up polls on my personal mac after syncing form github?

## BUGS
* Why is my md page on github pages not rendering? https://purplehey.github.io/Carrots.md

## Learning
Python Coding Practice:
[Coding Bat](http://codingbat.com/python)
Figure out how [timezone stuff](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/topics/i18n/timezones/) work in the Django environment.
### Cyber Security
* Digital Signatures - the public and private keys are in ~/.ssh.  There are different ways to generate these keys.  Cliff recommended I use [ED25519](https://ed25519.cr.yp.to/index.html).  You use:

>ssh-keygen -t ed25519

to generate the keys.

### Development Environment
* Get it so I can [switch between](http://mherman.org/blog/2013/09/16/managing-multiple-github-accounts/#.WpV50xPwbOQ) my personal github account and the work gethub account.
âœ“ * Install the PreDawn theme package in the sublime [PreDawn Theme](http://jamiewilson.io/predawn/)
* more [environment goodies]()
* Get a few sublime text plugin's
  * [date time](https://gist.github.com/robcowie/1323194)
  * [sitepoint suggestions](https://www.sitepoint.com/10-essential-sublime-text-plugins-full-stack-developer/) - some that look cool:
    * run git commands from inside sublime
    * auto expander thing so h5 auto expands to all the goop you need to start a well formed html5 page.
