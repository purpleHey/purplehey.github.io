A list of carrots that I can come back to when I get something useful done first!

* Get a few sublime text plugin's
  * [date time](https://gist.github.com/robcowie/1323194)
  * [sitepoint suggestions](https://www.sitepoint.com/10-essential-sublime-text-plugins-full-stack-developer/) - some that look cool:
    * run git commands from inside sublime
    * auto expander thing so h5 auto expands to all the goop you need to start a well formed html5 page.
