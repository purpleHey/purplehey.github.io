# Python Lists, Dictionaries, Sets and Tuples

Lists are mutable, as are Dictionaries i.e. you can change a value in the object and it works.  
Dictionaries are not ordered.

Tuples are not mutable.
The only methods for tuples are **index()**, and **count()**
Use tuples like const in C when you don't want any other code to change the values.

Sets are unordered collections of unique elements.
